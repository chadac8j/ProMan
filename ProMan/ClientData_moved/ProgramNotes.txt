notes for LLI software
indexListSmall has each unit, building if multi-unit, and portfolio as members
should I create a building/unit for "PORTFOLIO"?  currently I don't, but this could cause problems


indexList has all keys in the report structure

now I haved SavedData.dat in readonly mode to protect from users changing data manually
